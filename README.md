Hi, I'm Phillip Rogers. Welcome to my GitHub page!

I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Linguistics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Broadly speaking, my research seeks to understand the diversity of human languages and constraints on that diversity. I have current research projects investigating a wide range of linguistic phenomena from the distribution of language features across the globe to statistical patterns within the lexicon. I employ a diverse toolkit across these projects, using computational, corpus, experimental, quantitative, descriptive, and fieldwork methods.

Feel free to reach out to me at phillip @ ucsb dot edu.
